    "- Bank\n",
    "- AML COO worried about current tx monitoring platform not up to modern requirements\n",
    "- x transact w/ FATF blacklist; monitors CIBs and MSBs tightly\n",
    "- competing banks may get ahead in predictive analytics\n",
    "    - can't lose out to the competition\n",
    "\n",
    "BAU methodology for flagging suspicious tx:\n",
    "- customer tx'ing habits are predictable\n",
    "- data needs to be streamed in real-time\n",
    "    - fraudulent injections occur suddenly\n",
    "- typical behavior is used as benchmark against future incoming tx's\n",
    "- if a customer has been flagged in the past, bank monitors account closer\n",
    "\n",
    "Important nerdy stuff:\n",
    "- model continuously updates\n",
    "- past flags increase likelihood of fraudulent tx being true positive\n",
    "- false positives are ok, but might damage reputation with customers\n",
    "- false negatives are expensive\n",
    "    - i.e. we want to minimize likelihood of true fraud by minimizing false negatives\n",
    "    \n",
    "To do:\n",
    "- present business problem\n",
    "- propose how we will build detection model\n",
    "    - deep-dive into data the bank has provided us\n",
    "        - as Step -1, clean the data so its useful\n",
    "    - determine what additional data we need\n",
    "    - determine implementation of model\n",
    "        - real-time data streaming + auto flag OR historical audit?\n",
    "    - come up with benchmarks we can use to measure legitimacy of transactions\n",
    "        - e.g. if a tx falls within alpha < 0.05, should it be flagged?\n",
    "    - universal model VS per customer model\n",
    "        - cheap or expensive?"
